# Password Cracker

> **IMPORTANT: FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY — USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

## About

This repository contains a small **Password Cracker** tool intended for learning, research, and defensive security exercises (e.g., understanding weak passwords, testing your own systems). It is **not** intended for unauthorized access, intrusion, or any illegal activity.

## ⚠️ Legal & Ethical Warning

**Do not use this tool on systems, accounts, or data you do not own or do not have explicit permission to test.** Unauthorized use may be illegal and could result in civil or criminal penalties.

By using this software you acknowledge that you understand and accept all legal and ethical responsibilities. **The author is not responsible for any damage, data loss, legal consequences, or other harm resulting from the use (or misuse) of this tool. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

## Features

* Educational implementation showing common password cracking techniques.
* Configurable wordlists and basic rule support.
* Logging and reporting for controlled testing.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+



## Usage (Educational / Defensive Only)

1. Prepare a controlled test environment — e.g., a local VM, intentionally vulnerable lab machine, or a service you own.
2. Use only test accounts and never real user credentials.
3. Configure the wordlist and options in the configuration file or via CLI (see comments in the scripts).



> **Note:** This README intentionally avoids showing step-by-step instructions for attacking real accounts. Keep your testing lawful and responsible.

## Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a serious vulnerability in any third-party system during your research, follow a responsible disclosure process: notify me privately, give me time to respond, and avoid public disclosure until a fix is available.

## Logging & Safety Tips

* Always run cracking tests in an isolated environment.
* Keep detailed logs of what you test and when — this helps with audits and accountability.
* Limit the scope of any test and obtain written permission if someone else’s resources are involved.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome but must follow ethical guidelines. Do not submit code or documentation that facilitates illegal activity or evasion of protections. Suggested contributions include improving defensive features, adding educational examples, improving README clarity, and adding unit tests for safe components.

## License

Choose a license that fits your intent. If you want to restrict misuse, consider a license that requires recipients to follow responsible use (note: license enforcement is a legal topic; consult counsel if needed). For simple open-source usage, include a standard license file (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0).

## Contact

If you need help turning this project into a purely educational lab (safe configs, VM images, recommended wordlists, or demos), ask and I can suggest safe steps and resources.
